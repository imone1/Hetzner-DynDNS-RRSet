The Hetzner-DynDNS-RRSet script effectively updates your DNS records on Hetzner's platform whenever your IP address changes. Here’s a simple breakdown:

- If your IP changes, the script sends a request to the Hetzner API, updating your DNS.
- This ensures your domain always points to the correct IP.

## ⚙️ Configuration Settings
You’ll need to provide:

- Your Hetzner API token: This can be found in your Hetzner Console.
- The domain name you wish to manage.
- Any subdomains, if applicable.

Take your time to fill in these details accurately.
